# Merging Code

The following conditions must be met before code is merged to *.py files.

- Passed all GitHub Actions + CI checks
- Be approved by 1 user other than the submitter

The code will then be automatically merged by a bot.

If the change is not merged, cycle the 'merge when green' tag.

Non *.py files can be forced through but generally should still be reviewed.
